# sieve-algorithm
Sieves algorithm is an algorithm of number theory which is used to print like n number of primes numbers or this kind of problems.  Easily we can print the n number of prime numbers by just using the sieves algorithm. Suppose we are n numbers and we have to print the prime numbers between n. So at first, we can initialize all the numbers as 0 which means all the numbers are prime between 0 and n. Because prime numbers start with 2, we can find out which of these numbers between 2 to n are divisible by 2, just make them 1 which means no they are not prime numbers. Now check the next one that means 3. Now make those numbers 1 who are divisible by 3. Then in the next 4, 4 will not be needed to be taken because it is already made 1 for the reason of divisible by 2.  This process will continue till then root n. After that just print the indexes who are still 0, because those are the prime numbers.
